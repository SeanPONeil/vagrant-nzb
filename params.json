The goal of the project is to minimize the hassle it can be to set them all up individually and also to make them portable. The first version of the tool can to some extend manage this for [SabNZBd](http://sabnzbd.org/), [Sickbeard](http://sickbeard.com/) and [Couchpotato](https://couchpota.to/). Although this project is aimed at using usenet for downloads you can use torrents or some other method instead.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nYou need [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Quickstart linux\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/argilzar/vagrant-nzb.git\r\n$ cd vagrant-nzb\r\n$ vagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-41397996-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
