{"name":"Vagrant-nzb","tagline":"Vagrant setup files for SabNZBd+, Sickbeard, Couchpotato, Headphones, Newznab and so forth","body":"### What is it?\r\nvagrant-nzb is a tool that can help you setup [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) boxes for the most popular usenet media tools. The goal of the project is to minimize the hassle it can be to set them all up individually and also to make them portable. The first version of the tool can to some extend manage this for [SabNZBd](http://sabnzbd.org/), [Sickbeard](http://sickbeard.com/) and [Couchpotato](https://couchpota.to/). Although this project is aimed at using usenet for downloads you can use torrents or some other method instead.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nYou need [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Quickstart\r\n\r\nUse this method if you are not changing any of the default options.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/argilzar/vagrant-nzb.git\r\n$ cd vagrant-nzb\r\n$ vagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\nVagrant will create the boxes spin them up. The first time it runs it may take some time as the [default box image](http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/raring/current/raring-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box) needs to be downloaded. You can then open up the services in a browser\r\n\r\n* [Sabnzb](http://localhost:8080/)\r\n* [Sickbeard](http://localhost:8081/)\r\n* [Couchpotato](http://localhost:5050/)\r\n\r\nYou will need to do some config once the services have started. For SabNZB run the wizzard, downloads will be placed in (vagrant dir)/sabnzbdplus/Downloads/complete. For Sickbeard set the processing folder to /mnt/nzb/sabnzbdplus/Downloads/complete.
